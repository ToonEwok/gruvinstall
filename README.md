# using this as a dev log
there appears to be some issue with the system booting after the script is finished, im assuming the issue is pertaining to resolution but unsure
well removing the dotconfig seems to be allowing it to boot, but i also forgot that sddm uses the 'uwsm hypr' or whatever intially so idk yet
---the issue is definetly in the hypr config, im assuming it's display related still
